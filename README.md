Game of Life and Four Color Theorem - Display txt

Intro text:
Hello! Welcome to our humble website! 

We believe that math is severely underrated, and it honestly deserves a lot more attention than it gets. So this our small contribution to sharing a little bit of neat math around!

We have compiled three of our favorite subjects to show you--including extras for you to play with. Enjoy!

----------------------------------

Four Color Theorem:

Have you ever wondered: “if I colored maps for a living, what is the least number of colored crayons I would need to do my job?”

If yes (or even if you haven’t), then the four color theorem is for you!! 
The four color theorem revolves around a simple statement: 
You can color any map with at most four colors .

This statement was put forth in 1852 by Francis Guthrie when he wondered what the minimum number of colors would be needed in order to color a map of New England--but how do we know this statement is true for every single map?

Disproving this theorem is very easy. All you have to do is find one map where it requires a total of 5 colors to make every region in the map a different color from all the regions touching it. (Note, a bunch of region meetings at a point technically doesn’t count as touching).

Do you think this map can be colored with 4 colors?


Proving this statement is universally true, on the other hand, is very difficult as it requires proof that every single map that can be possibly created obeys this rule. There have been many attempts to prove this theorem since 1852, but all of them have been found to be fallacious. In the last few decades, however, there has emerged a generally accepted proof for this theorem that includes the use of computer programs as a part of the proof (although there is still some disagreement over if it is a definitive proof)!

The beauty of this theorem is that you can try it yourself! As long as you have something to write with and something to write on, you can make maps of your own and color them with only four colors if you’re clever. 

If you’re feeling bored, you can even try to come up with the first map that requires 5 colors and throw the math community into a frenzy!

Below, I included a program written by ___. This allows you to construct any wild map you want with straight lines, and then the program will automatically figure out how to color your map with only four colors or less. It’s really fun to play around with and see how even ridiculously complex maps can be colored in to abide by this simple rule!

Hey there! You seem to have stumbled upon our Tessellation Perfection!
We sure do love our shapes on this page… Have you ever just noticed how we are surrounded by shapes? Just think of it, a lot of our everyday objects were made from blueprints that combine simple shapes together. Maybe the clothes you’re wearing have a pattern; another great instance of shapes!

Now this is our Tessellation Perfection, not Shapes Amaze. So… what is a tessellation you may ask? A tessellation is a periodic tiling that has a repeating pattern with no gaps or overlaps. Seems complex right? Well… not really. Tessellations can open the door to a whole new world of math in geometry, but we just need to focus on the basics.

Some tessellations can be really simple, like a checkerboard as so:

Essentially, tessellations can be repeated patterns. You can rotate, slide (translate), and reflect (mirror) polygons to make your very own tessellation. (Don’t worry, at the end of this page there are some cool pdfs where you can possibly make your own tessellations AND color some!)

2D tessellations can come in two forms. They are either classified as being a Regular Tessellation or are a Semi-Regular Tessellation. 

The Regular Tessellation is like your good old checkerboard pattern. These tessellations can be made from one REGULAR polygon, like an equilateral triangle, square, and hexagon.

The Semi-Regular Tessellation is where things start to get a bit crazy. These tessellations are made with more than one REGULAR polygon. Here’s a quick example of one that uses octagons and squares:

Now, tessellations don’t necessarily have to be made from polygons. Artists and mathematicians have taken their spin on the topic. One Dutch graphic artist, MC Escher, created some awesome tessellations by using animal shapes, as seen below.

Some of our other favorite tessellations include this bunny one!

Now, you’re pretty well informed when it comes to tessellations! I suggest you look at some of these cool worksheets and make your own tessellations! 
This one helps you create one, but you’re more than welcome to create tessellations with YOUR favorite polygons!

This second worksheet is for coloring, and it shows a more complicated semi-regular tessellation!

Be sure to post your wonderful creations on Instagram and tag us @talkaboutmath for a chance to be featured on our page!

If you’re still amazed by tessellations, might I suggest you visit the National Museum of Mathematics because they have an awesome interactive exhibit called Tessellation Station! There, you can make your own tessellations on a magnetic board!
